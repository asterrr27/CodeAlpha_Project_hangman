# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman game! This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic word-guessing game, written in Python.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: The game will randomly select a word from a predefined list.
2. **Guess a Letter**: You have to guess the letters in the word. Each correct guess reveals the positions of the letter in the word.
3. **Tries**: You have 6 tries to guess the word correctly. An incorrect guess will decrease the number of tries left.
4. **Winning**: If you guess all the letters in the word before running out of tries, you win!
5. **Losing**: If you run out of tries before guessing the word, the game is over.
